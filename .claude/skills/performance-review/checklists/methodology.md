# Methodology & build configuration checklist

**Purpose.** Before any code-level finding is acted on, the team has a benchmark that exercises the function, a profile that confirms it is hot, and a build configuration that is not silently dropping speed on the floor. Findings in this category often outweigh anything in the code-level categories — they are the foundation, run them first.

**popnei.** Speed is goal 4 of `docs/objectives.md`, after right, usable from Python and in the browser: a VCF parsed at the speed of compiled tools, per variant work in fused passes with rayon across records, the linear algebra on the system BLAS natively and on faer in wasm, and every claim measured on a stated dataset against pyNei and against plink2 and GMMAT, before and after. `docs/rust_core.md` holds the baselines and section 6 of it how to reproduce them. A timing taken through Python is taken after `maturin develop --release`: the default build is unoptimized.

**Triggers.** Always.

**Skip when.** Never skipped.

## Rules

- **No optimization without a benchmark.** A function that is supposedly hot but has no `criterion` benchmark in `benches/` (or equivalent harness) is a finding. The benchmark is the first deliverable; code changes follow it. A consistent naming convention (`<module>_<workload>_bench`) makes baselines easy to track.
- **Use `std::hint::black_box`.** Benchmarks must wrap inputs in `black_box(...)` and consume outputs the same way; constant-folded benchmarks are the most common cause of "wins" that disappear in production. Any `b.iter(|| f(constant))` without `black_box` is a Likely finding.
- **Profiles must come from release builds with debug info.** Add to `Cargo.toml`:
  ```toml
  [profile.release]
  debug = true
  ```
  or a dedicated `[profile.bench-with-debug]`. Profiling a stripped `--release` binary gives unreadable flamegraphs.
- **Use sampling profilers, not just timers.** `perf record` + `flamegraph` (Linux) or `samply` (cross-platform) is the default for "where does time go". `cargo flamegraph --bench <name>` is the shortest path. Wall-time deltas alone do not localize the bottleneck.
- **Use heap profilers for allocation hypotheses.** `dhat-rs` or `heaptrack` answer "how many allocations, of what size, from where". Wall time alone cannot tell you whether a fix removed allocator pressure or moved it.
- **Benchmark before *and* after, on the same machine, in the same configuration.** Quote both numbers in the PR. Reviewers cannot validate "this is faster" without the before number; criterion's `--save-baseline` and `--baseline` are the supported flow.
- **A single tight within-run CI is not a trustworthy cross-commit number.** Run-to-run variance from system load can shift criterion's median by 20–25 % even with the within-run CI in the 1 % range — criterion's CI describes one run, not the population of runs. Any cross-commit comparison `≥ 5 %` that would trigger a code rollback needs *either* two clean measurements per side, *or* a **revert experiment**: actually revert the change, re-bench, and confirm both directions agree on sign and magnitude. The revert experiment is the cheapest insurance against rolling back a real win that happens to compare against an unlucky-fast prior measurement.
- **When the hypothesis is about a countable quantity, gate on the count, not on wall time.** Allocation count and bytes (DHAT), callgrind instruction counts, syscall counts, and messages or peak depth per channel are the same on every run of the same code on the same input; wall time is not (the 20–25 % cross-run shift above). "The fix removed the per-record allocation — DHAT count fell from N per record to 0" is checkable regardless of timing noise; "the fix saved 4 % wall" often is not. Use the deterministic count as the primary merge gate — it confirms the mechanism — and one wall-time comparison as the secondary check that the removed cost was worth removing. (Argued in hotpath's profiling guide: https://hotpath.rs/blog/profiling-rust-guide.)
- **Build configuration is part of the program.** Audit `Cargo.toml` and `.cargo/config.toml` for `[profile.release]` settings. Whole-program inlining via `lto = "fat"` and `codegen-units = 1` can produce wins that dwarf any code-level tweak; do not debate inline hints when these are unset.
  ```toml
  [profile.release]
  lto = "fat"          # whole-program inlining; +compile time
  codegen-units = 1    # one unit, more inlining opportunity
  opt-level = 3
  debug = true         # for profiling; otherwise debug = "line-tables-only"
  ```
  Each of these is a separate experiment. `lto = "thin"` is a cheaper middle ground. **`panic = "abort"` is not on this list for popnei:** pyo3 turns a Rust panic into a Python exception, which needs unwinding, and with `abort` a panic ends the interpreter. A profile used only for benchmarks could set it.
- **Profile-guided optimization (PGO) is on the table for stable critical paths.** For a library shipped as a wheel, PGO is the highest-leverage build-time change after LTO. The recipe is documented in `rustc --profile-use` / `cargo-pgo`; cost is a more elaborate build flow that runs the binary on a representative workload between two compiles.
- **Allocator choice is a one-line change.** Trying `mimalloc` or `jemallocator` as the global allocator behind a feature flag is cheap. The mechanism behind the win on multithreaded workloads is per-thread caches that eliminate lock contention inside the allocator; the size of the win is workload-specific. A workload with heavy allocation traffic and no allocator A/B benchmark is a Likely finding.
  ```rust
  #[global_allocator]
  static GLOBAL: mimalloc::MiMalloc = mimalloc::MiMalloc;
  ```
- **`target-cpu` is set when the deployment target is known.** `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"` or a fixed microarchitecture (`x86-64-v3`, `znver3`, …) in `.cargo/config.toml`. Required for AVX2/AVX-512 autovectorization on x86_64. On aarch64 (this project's host and container) NEON is already in the baseline target, so `target-cpu` moves far less — do not expect an x86-sized win from it here. **Do not** use `native` for a binary distributed to other machines.
- **Microbenchmarks lie about cache behavior.** A benchmark that calls one function repeatedly with the same input fits in L1 and looks artificially fast. Real workloads thrash. A single-input criterion bench standing in for a streaming workload is a Likely finding with the recommendation to add a streaming bench.
- **`iter_batched` setup is *sampled* under `--profile-time`.** Criterion times only the body, but a sampling profiler (`samply`, `perf record`, `cargo flamegraph`) records every on-CPU instruction in the whole bench routine — including per-iter `setup()`. A heavy fixture clone in setup will dominate the profile and starve the actually-hot code of samples. Prefer building fixtures once outside `b.iter` and borrowing them per iteration. If a per-iter setup is unavoidable, run a contamination sanity-check: the top-level inclusive-time hit on the bench thread should be the function under test (`≥ 50 %`), not the setup closure (`c_with_alloca`, `iter_batched::{{closure}}`, `Routine::profile`). Anything else means the profile is unusable for code-level findings.
- **Benches that align with the API's internal state need an in-bench verification assertion.** A prime-loop that "fills up to a flush boundary", a setup that "warms past the first reallocation", an `iter_batched` body that "triggers exactly one syscall" — each is making a load-bearing claim about internal state, and off-by-one boundary logic produces nominal numbers that look reasonable while measuring the wrong work. The failure is silent unless something dramatic moves the number (e.g. a 1000× speedup that catches your eye). Verify in the bench: assert on a return value, on a `#[doc(hidden)] pub` peek into internal state, or on an after-the-fact counter — whatever proves the body did what the bench's name claims. The assertion belongs in the bench file, not in a manual one-off check, because it's the only thing that survives the next refactor.
- **Compiler version drift is real.** Pin `rust-toolchain.toml` if absolute numbers matter; autovectorization decisions change between rustc versions without warning. When popnei pins its toolchain, a pin bump invalidates saved baselines: re-run them, and name the bump as part of the complexity cost of a fix that needs a newer API.
- **One change per measurement.** Each PR names the single hypothesis being tested. Bundling allocator + LTO + refactor produces an unreadable result.

## Output

Findings in this category often go in section 4 of the synthesized report ("Build / toolchain configuration") rather than section 5 ("Code-level findings"). Flag which is which in your output: prepend `[build]` to the title for build-config findings, `[bench]` for missing-or-wrong-benchmark findings, `[profile]` for missing-profile findings.
